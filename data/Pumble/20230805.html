<h2>6. ADD-ON ACCESS, INSTALLATION, AND USE</h2>
<ol type="a">&gt;
<li>CAKE.com allows Add-On Providers to offer you Add-Ons through the Marketplace. Your installation or use of any Add-Ons is completely voluntary, at your own risk, and within your sole discretion. CAKE.com does not operate or provide Add-Ons, and Add-Ons are subject to their own Add-On terms and conditions and privacy policy. You understand and agree that by using or installing an Add-On, you agree to the Add-On terms and conditions and acknowledge that you have reviewed the Add-On privacy policy. CAKE.com is in no way liable or responsible for your installation or use of the Add-Ons or any claims, issues, or complaints you have relating to the Add-Ons. You also understand that Add-Ons may collect, process, disclose, store, and/or delete your information, including personal information, in a manner that is different than CAKE.com, and that by using or installing an Add-On you are providing your information, including personal information to the Add-On Provider who will act as the controller or business, as defined by applicable privacy laws, with respect to any such information.</li>
<li>Notwithstanding the foregoing, CAKE.com shall collect and handle payment relating to your use of Add-Ons on behalf of Add-On Providers to the extent applicable. Add-On Providers will determine the amounts you must pay to use their Add-Ons, and you agree to pay those amounts in U.S. dollars in full, and in advance, without deducting or allowing the deduction of any currency conversion, wire transfer, remittance, applicable tax, or other charges related to the payment. The fees are exclusive of any VAT or other taxes and public duties, except where explicitly stated to the contrary. It is each User’s responsibility to bear all public duties related to the purchase of any Add-Ons.</li>
<li>All payments are handled by a third-party payment processor. CAKE.com is not responsible for the processing of your payment and shall not be liable for any matter in connection therewith. Paid fees are non-refundable, and you understand and agree that CAKE.com is not responsible for and has no authority to negotiate or respond to any payment disputes you have with the Add-On Provider.</li>
<li>CAKE.com allows Add-On Providers to offer Add-Ons to you in the Marketplace, but CAKE.com has no obligation to offer, continue to offer, delete, and/or maintain any particular Add-Ons. CAKE.com may, within its sole discretion, discontinue or make unavailable any Add-Ons in its Marketplace with no liability to you. CAKE.com will endeavor where practicable to provide thirty (30) days prior notice before discontinuing or making unavailable any Add-Ons, but you acknowledge and agree that that is not always possible because CAKE.com does not provide the Add-Ons.</li>
<li><strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO ADD-ONS.</strong> By allowing Add-On Providers to offer Add-Ons to you in the Marketplace, CAKE.com in no way endorses or sponsors any Add-Ons or Add-On Providers and makes no representations or warranties with respect to any Add-Ons. Except as otherwise provided in a writing by us, we provide our Marketplace and any Add-Ons contained thereon “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, because Add-On Providers operate and provide Add-Ons and not CAKE.com, CAKE.com does not represent or warrant that the Add-Ons are accurate, complete, reliable, current, error-free, secure, timely, or will be uninterrupted or of satisfactory quality. You understand and agree that CAKE.com cannot and does not represent or warrant that any Add-Ons are free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Add-Ons. User is solely responsible for any damage User may suffer resulting from the use of or inability to use the Add-Ons. No oral or written information or advice given by CAKE.com or its authorized representatives shall create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of CAKE.com’s obligations.</li>

<h2>10. SUBSCRIPTION</h2>
<p>By creating a User Account within our Services, you automatically start your Free Plan. You may choose to switch from the Free Plan to any Subscription Plan at any time. Once you choose to do so, we will start to apply the respective subscription fees in accordance with the applicable Subscription Plan. <strong>Your Subscription Plan will continue for the length of the Subscription Term you select, and will automatically renew for additional periods of the same length unless you cancel it.</strong> Your subscription fee in effect at the time of your automatic renewal will continue for your renewal term unless we notify you thirty (30) days in advance of the end of the Subscription Term for a yearly Subscription Plan or ten (10) days in advance of the end of the Subscription Term for a monthly Subscription Plan of a new subscription fee in which case the new subscription fee will apply to the renewal term. <strong>You can cancel your Subscription Plan at any time via your User Account settings and your Subscription Plan will terminate upon the expiry of the then-current Subscription Term</strong>.</p>
<p>Subscription Plans for our Services are charged either monthly or annually (your Subscription Term), at your selection. All payments for the Subscription Plan are due in full, and in advance, no later than the first day of the applicable Subscription Term.</p>
<p>Prices set out in the Price Plan are subject to change at any time. To the extent permitted under applicable law, any price will become binding on the Enterprise upon the following conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>CAKE.com has sent notice in advance of any such change; and</li>
<li>The Enterprise did not unsubscribe from the Subscription Plan within such a period or by the end of the then-current Subscription Term, whichever date is later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such notice may be sent to you by email to your most recently provided email address or posted on the Services or by any other manner chosen by CAKE.com in its commercially reasonable discretion. You will be deemed to have received any such notice that is posted on the Services on the day following the date it was posted.</p>
<h2>11. PROMOTIONAL TRIAL-PERIODS</h2>
<p>CAKE.com may offer a free trial period (“<strong>Free Trial</strong>”) of any or part of our Services. CAKE.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the eligibility of a User for a Free Trial as well as to determine whether to revoke any such Free Trial. Free Trial Users may, at any time choose not to continue to a Subscription Plan by cancelling before the end of the Free Trial. If you do not cancel, at the end of your Free Trial, your User Account will be automatically subscribed to the applicable Subscription Plan, and you hereby authorize CAKE.com to charge your designated account at the rates in effect at that time. TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AND AVOID BEING CHARGED, YOU MUST CANCEL BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD.</p>
<p>CAKE.com may require a User to have a valid payment instrument, such as a credit card or other permitted payment method, before using the Free Trial. In this case, we may validate that payment method, including by requesting a temporary authorization from the financial institution issuing your payment instrument. If we determine that your payment instrument is invalid, without limiting any of our other rights, we may revoke any benefits you may have received as part of the Free Trial.</p>
<p>Free Trials are available to new Enterprises only.</p>
<h2>12. PAYMENT</h2>
<p>Anyone who subscribes to our Services, including anyone who has permitted or caused another person or Enterprise to participate in a Subscription Plan, is deemed to have agreed to and accepted liability for the payments under such Subscription Plan. You hereby authorize CAKE.com to charge to your designated account, relating to the Services and Subscription Plan you select, and you agree to pay all such fees in U.S. dollars and in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
<p>Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to automatically renew your subscription, you understand it will automatically renew, and you authorize us (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable fees and any taxes using any payment method we have for you.</p>
<p>User must keep all the billing data in the User Account complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date). If User fails to provide or properly update any of the foregoing information, User agrees that CAKE.com may continue charging for the Services unless User has terminated the Subscription Plan as set forth herein and that User is still liable for the amounts charged. If your default payment instrument is declined for any reason, we may at our sole discretion, deny access to the Subscription Plan immediately.</p>
<p>All sums payable to CAKE.com hereunder shall be paid in full, and in advance of the Subscription Term, without deducting or allowing the deduction of any currency conversion, wire transfer, remittance, applicable tax, or other charges related to the payment. The fees are exclusive of any VAT or other taxes and public duties, except where CAKE.com has explicitly stated to the contrary. It is each User’s responsibility to bear all public duties related to the purchase of the Service.</p>
<p>All payments are handled by a third-party payment processor. CAKE.com is not responsible for the processing of your payment and shall not be liable for any matter in connection therewith.</p>
<p>Paid fees are non-refundable. If this Agreement or a Subscription Plan is terminated or varied during a certain Subscription Term, the User shall not be entitled to any refund concerning that Subscription Term. In addition, payments made for future Subscription Terms will not be refunded unless the Parties explicitly agree otherwise.</p>
<h2>13. UPGRADING OR DOWNGRADING PLAN</h2>
<p>You may upgrade your plan at any time via your User Account. If you upgrade your plan to include Extra Features or additional Extra Features, you will be immediately charged for the chosen upgrade, on a pro rata basis, and initiate a new Subscription Term. If you upgrade from a monthly Subscription Term to an annual Subscription Term, you will be immediately charged for and initiate the annual Subscription Term on an ongoing basis. If you upgrade your plan to include additional Seats, you will be charged for the new Seats on a pro rata basis for the then-current Subscription Term and the total (increased) number of Seats for the next Subscription Term.</p>
<p>You may downgrade your Subscription Plan or downgrade to a Free Plan at any time via your User Account settings, and your plan will change upon the expiry of the then-current Subscription Term, with limited exceptions.</p>
<p>If you would like to reduce or eliminate the number of Extra Features on your plan, after your then-current Subscription Term expires, your access to the Extra Features offered in the current Subscription Plan will be denied, and you will be charged for the downgraded Subscription Plan, based on the Subscription Term you choose. If you would like to change from an annual plan to a monthly plan, after your annual Subscription Term expires, you will be charged for the monthly Subscription Term. If you would like to reduce the number of Seats on you plan, after your then-current Subscription Term expires, you will be charged based on the new number of Seats for the next Subscription Term. There will be no refund for any reduction of the number of Extra Features or Seats during the then-current Subscription Term. Any reduction of Extra Feature or Seats will occur effective in the subsequent renewal term.</p>
<p>If you change from an annual Subscription Plan to a monthly Subscription Plan with additional Extra Features, you will obtain immediate access to the additional Extra Features in the upgraded Subscription Plan. The previous payment made for the annual plan will be calculated on a pro rata basis and, depending on the balance, you may obtain credit or you may be charged immediately for the outstanding payment for the monthly Subscription Plan. In the event you have the remaining credit, such credit may be applied against the amounts payable for the next Subscription Term. No refunds will be provided.</p>

<p>We may provide information about third-party products, services, activities, or events, or we may allow third parties to make their content and information available on or through the Services (collectively, “<strong>Third-Party Content</strong>”). We provide Third-Party Content as a service to those interested in such content. Your dealings or correspondence with third parties and your use of or interaction with any Third-Party Content are solely between you and the third party. CAKE.com does not control or endorse, and makes no representations or warranties regarding, any Third-Party Content, and your access to and use of such Third-Party Content is at your own risk.</p>
<h2>26. JURISDICTION AND CHOICE OF LAW; DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p><strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with CAKE.com and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Representative Actions. You and CAKE.com agree that any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services is between you and CAKE.com and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Arbitration of Disputes. </strong>Except for small claims disputes in which you or CAKE.com seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or CAKE.com seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, <strong>you and CAKE.com waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security, (collectively, “Dispute(s)”), resolved in court</strong>. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against CAKE.com you agree to first contact CAKE.com and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) to CAKE.com by email at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805115822/mailto:support@cake.com">support@cake.com</a> or by certified mail addressed to CAKE.com Inc, 2100 GENG RD STE 210, Palo Alto, CA 94303, USA. The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and CAKE.com cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in Santa Clara County in the State of California. You and CAKE.com agree that Disputes will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules is available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230805115822/https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">JAMS website</a> and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</li>
<li>You and CAKE.com agree that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 26 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, <em>et seq</em>. (the “<strong>FAA</strong>”), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, this Agreement, and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one Enterprise’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding, or preside over any proceeding involving more than one Enterprise.</li>
<li>The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator, CAKE.com, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.</li>
<li>You and CAKE.com agree that the Party that initiates the arbitration shall pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and CAKE.com agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Santa Clara County in the State of California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</li>
<li>Any Dispute will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of California, except to the extent preempted by U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the Parties that is not subject to arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court will be resolved in the state or federal courts of California and the United States, respectively, sitting in Santa Clara County in the State of California.</li>
<li><strong>Any Dispute must be filed within one (1) year after the relevant claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred, which means that you and CAKE.com will not have the right to assert the claim.</strong></li>
<li>If any portion of this Section 26 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from this Agreement; (b) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 26 or the Parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 26; and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 26 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 26 will be enforceable.</li>
<h2>27. ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
<p>This Agreement (as amended from time to time), including any agreements incorporated by reference herein, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the Parties with respect to that subject matter.</p>
<p>In case of conflict between any provision herein and any statement, representation, or other information published on the Services or contained in any other materials or communications, the provision in this Agreement shall prevail.</p>
<h2>28. YOUR PROMISES TO US</h2>
<p>You promise to us that (a) you are not located in a country subject to a United States government embargo, nor are you located in a country that has been designated by the United States government as a “terrorist supporting” country; (b) you are not listed on any United States government list of prohibited or restricted parties; (c) you assume the risk of any information submitted by you; and (d) you will not disclose nor allow to be disclosed by any means any confidential information belonging to us that you become aware of.</p>
<h2>29. ASSIGNMENT</h2>
<p>This Agreement is binding upon you, your heirs, executors, beneficiaries, successors, and assigns, and you may not assign this Agreement to any other party without our prior written consent. Such consent may be withheld in our sole discretion, and any purported assignment without such consent shall be null and void. We may assign this Agreement to any party without notice thereof to you.</p>
