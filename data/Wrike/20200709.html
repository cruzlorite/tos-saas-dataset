<h4>1. Acceptance of terms<a id="acceptance-of-terms"></a></h4>
<div>
<p>By using Wrike`s online and offline products and services (collectively, "the Service" or “Services”), provided by Wrike, Inc. (collectively, "Wrike," "We" or "Us") you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), together with our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200709030947/https://www.wrike.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. The TOS may be updated by us from time to time without notice. You can review the most current version of the TOS at any time at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200709030947/https://www.wrike.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wrike.com/terms/</a>. This TOS governs your access to and use of any Wrike website, any order you place through a Wrike website, by telephone or any other means, and, as applicable, your use or attempted use of Wrike’s products and services (collectively, “Your Use”).</p>
<p>Your Use of the Website shall be deemed to constitute your consent to be bound by this Agreement and shall be enforceable in the same way as if you had signed this Agreement.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE, DO NOT ORDER, AND DO NOT USE ANY WRIKE PRODUCT OR SERVICE.</p>
<p>THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDES A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY “CLAIM” (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED HEREIN) TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEEDING IN COURT. IF YOU WANT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED “PRE-DISPUTE, MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” DESCRIBES THE PROCEDURES YOU MUST FOLLOW TO DO SO. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY CLAIM INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p>Wrike only offers accounts on behalf of business entities and does not offer personal accounts on behalf of individuals. You represent and agree that (i) you are entering into this agreement on behalf of the company or other legal entity (collectively, the “Business User”) that you may specify, (ii) that your account is for, and held in the name of, the Business User (and not any individual), (iii) such Business User has full legal capacity and is in good standing in the jurisdiction in which it is formed, (iv) you have full legal capacity and authority to bind yourself individually and such Business User to these TOS, and (iv) the terms "you" or "your,” as used herein shall, unless the context otherwise reasonably requires, refer to both (A) such Business User, and (B) the individual or individuals (the “Individual User(s)”) accessing or using the Service as authorized or invited by such Business User; provided, however, that each such Individual User(s) shall remain vicariously liable and be required to comply with these TOS even though the account may be held in the name of the Business User. If you do not meet the requirements above, or if you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you may not use the Service.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Wrike, such as service announcements and administrative messages, and that these communications are considered part of Wrike membership and that you will not be able to opt out of receiving them.

You understand and agree that the Service is provided "as is" and that Wrike assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery of or failure to store any user content or settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, which access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet Service Provider charges).

In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.</p>
<p>You may not access the Service for purposes of monitoring its performance, availability, or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes, without Wrike's prior written consent.

<h4>6. Billing<a id="billing"></a></h4>

To view the specific details of your subscription plan, you can check the "Account Management - Subscription" page, available after logging into the Service. You will not receive a notice from us that your Free Trial has ended or that your paying subscription has begun.</p>
<p>Unless cancelled, your Service subscription will be automatically renewed at the end of your subscription period. We will bill the subscription fee plus any applicable tax to you. Your membership will automatically renew for successive subscriptions, without prior notice to you, unless and until you cancel your membership, or we terminate it. You must cancel your membership before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your payment method.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you are expressly agreeing that we are permitted to bill you a subscription fee, any applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Service. Additional charges may include service level changes you request. The subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each renewal thereafter, unless and until you cancel your membership. We will automatically bill you each billing period on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your membership. Except and to the extent required by applicable law (including, without limitation, Australia law), all fees and charges are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, or where you have elected to downgrade service levels or otherwise remove any paid component or feature. If you elect to upgrade your service level or otherwise add any paid component or feature, we will pro-rate the amount due based on the number of days remaining in your billing cycle; provided, however, that any such proration shall be based on your service level or paid components or features in existence immediately prior to your election to upgrade or add paid components or features.</p>
<p>If you change your service level (downgrade it), you may cause the loss of Content or features for your account. Wrike does not accept any liability for such loss. You may cancel your subscription to the Service at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. Except and to the extent required by applicable law (including, without limitation, Australia law), WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS OR ANY FEATURE OF COMPONENT THAT YOU HAVE PAID FOR BUT NOT USED.</p>
<p>In connection with your purchase and/or use of the Service you may be subject to taxes, including, without limitation, sales and use taxes, by any authority which has jurisdiction to impose such taxes. You agree that the obligation and payment of any such taxes shall be your sole and absolute responsibility, and you agree, that unless otherwise required by applicable law, to indemnify Wrike pursuant to the section below entitled “Indemnity” to the extent that Wrike incurs any obligations or other liabilities in connection with such taxes.</p>
<p>In the event that Licensee makes any payment via wire transfer, all associated outgoing and incoming bank fees (including, without limitation, Licensee’s bank fees and Wrike’s bank fees) (collectively, the “Bank Fees”) shall be Licensee’s responsibility and shall be recoverable by Wrike from Licensee. Licensee may include such Bank Fees at the time of the payment to Wrike. However, if such Bank Fees are not included then Wrike shall be entitled to full reimbursement of such Bank Fees from Licensee within 60 days of any applicable wire transfer initiated by Licensee.</p>
<p>Fee Increases</p>
<p>We may change the fees and charges in effect or add new fees and charges from time to time. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein (but subject to any applicable law), at the time of any renewal of your subscription you agree that we may increase your recurring fees up to the greater of (i) the then list price as publicly marketed on our website, or (ii) five percent (5%). We may, in our sole discretion, offer you a grace-period in which your fees will not increase for a certain period of time. If you do not accept the increase or addition to the existing fees, you may elect to terminate your account during the then current billing period and you shall not be liable for such fee increase after the applicable billing period; however, any later renewal of service will be subject to the increased fee structure. If your credit or debit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Service constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing you, and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.</p>

<div>
<p>Wrike is hereby authorized to incur, with prior notice to you, reasonable travel expenses when appropriate in performing your instructions.

</div>
<h4>27. Pre-Dispute, Mandatory Binding Arbitration, and Class Action Waiver<a id="pre-dispute-mandatory-binding-arbitration"></a></h4>
<div>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. YOU AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU MAY HAVE IN THE FUTURE MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY. THE RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS DISCOVERY OR THE RIGHT TO APPEAL, MAY BE MORE LIMITED OR MAY NOT EXIST.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY ONLY BRING A CLAIM IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU FURTHER AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
<p><b>Generally.</b> Arbitration is a method of resolving a Claim without filing a lawsuit. “Claim” means any dispute between you, the Wrike Parties, and/or any involved third party relating to your account, Your Use, your relationship with the Wrike Parties, or these TOS. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use of the products and services, your attempted use of the products and services, and any act or omission by the Wrike Parties or any third party related to your use or attempted use of the products and services. You, Wrike, the other Wrike Parties, or any involved third party may pursue a Claim. Wrike agrees to binding arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to binding arbitration should you have any Claims against Wrike. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to binding arbitration. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to binding arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>
<p><b>Exceptions to Binding Arbitration.</b> As an exception to binding arbitration, you and Wrike both retain the right to pursue, in a small claims court, any claim that is within that court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis. Wrike will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is pending only in that court. Binding arbitration also does not apply to disputes concerning trade secret misappropriation, patent infringement, copyright infringement or misuse, or trademark infringement or dilution.</p>
<p><b>Mandatory Pre-Dispute Procedures.</b> You acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim (subject to the exceptions above) against the Wrike Parties, you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us, including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our products and upon which you rely. You may send the written description by U.S. Mail to Wrike, Inc., 10 Almaden Blvd, Fl 10 Ste 1000 San Jose, CA 95113; Attn: General Counsel. You agree to negotiate with Wrike in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 60 days after Wrike’s receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.</p>
<p><b>Commencement of Arbitration.</b> You and Wrike agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (including the mandatory pre-dispute procedures outlined above) and that any proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be barred.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Location.</b>For your convenience, the arbitration may be conducted in the federal district where you reside. It may be held by telephone or through written submissions if both you and Wrike agree.</p>
<p><b>Sponsoring Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator.</b> You agree that any Claims shall be resolved by submitting the dispute to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator who is a retired judge or an experienced attorney with experience in the subject(s) of the Claim. The arbitrator shall be chosen from JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and the arbitration rules of the selected tribunal shall apply, which can be obtained by calling the selected tribunal.</p>
<p>The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these TOS and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you, Wrike or the other Wrike Parties.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Fees.</b> Wrike shall pay for all filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees for an arbitration initiated by either party. The parties shall each pay their own additional fees, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those for any attorneys, experts, documents, and witnesses.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Award.</b> The arbitrator shall follow substantive law and may order any relief if permitted by law. The arbitrator may award any form of individual relief, including injunctions and punitive damages, so long as they are in accordance with applicable law. The arbitrator may award costs or fees to a prevailing party, but only if the law expressly allows it. Although Wrike may have a right to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses under some laws if it prevails, Wrike agrees that it will not seek such an award, unless your Claims are determined by the arbitrator to be frivolous. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the arbitrator’s ability to award remedies provided by applicable law. Any award rendered shall include a written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA.</p>
<p><b>Enforceability.</b> This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Wrike, bankruptcy, assignment or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><b>Miscellaneous.</b> Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claims will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Wrike and shall not be modified except in writing by Wrike.</p>
<p><b>Amendments.</b> Wrike reserves the right to amend this arbitration provision at any time. Your continued use of any Wrike website, purchase of a Wrike product or service, or use or attempted use of a Wrike product or service, is affirmation of your consent to such changes. Should the changes to this arbitration provision be material, Wrike will provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out. Your continued use of any Wrike website, purchase of a Wrike product or service, or use or attempted use of a Wrike product or service, is affirmation of your consent to such material changes.</p>
<p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE, USE, OR ATTEMPTED USE OF A WRIKE PRODUCT OR SERVICE ( WHICHEVER COMES FIRST) BY WRITING TO WRIKE, INC. 10 ALMADEN BLVD, FL 10 STE 1000 SAN JOSE, CA 95113; ATTN: GENERAL COUNSEL. FOR YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SUBMIT A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE IDENTIFYING ANY WRIKE PRODUCT OR SERVICE YOU PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE WITHIN THE 30 DAYS AND THE DATE YOU FIRST PURCHASED, USED OR ATTEMPTED TO USE OF WRIKE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. UNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.</p>
</div>
<h4>27. Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies<a id="exclusive-venue-for-other-controversies"></a></h4>
<div>
<p>You agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Agreement (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed only in the state and federal courts located within the County of Santa Clara, State of California, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy.</p>
</div>
<h4>28. General information<a id="general-information"></a></h4>
<div>
<p><b>Entire Agreement.</b> The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and Wrike and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and Wrike with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Wrike services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.</p>
<p><b>Choice of Law and Forum.</b> Except to the extent required by applicable law or as otherwise set forth herein (including the arbitration provisions set forth above), (i) the TOS and the relationship between you and Wrike shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions, and (ii) You and Wrike agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the County of Santa Clara, State of California regardless of (A) your world-wide physical location, or (B) the jurisdiction where you purchased or use the Service.</p>
<p><b>Notice and Future Changes.</b> Wrike may provide you with notices, including those regarding modifications to the TOS (including the Privacy Policy), by email or via the web-site. You agree to review the TOS (including the Privacy Policy) periodically so that you are aware of any modifications. Your continued use of the Service after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the modified TOS (and all other agreements, policies, rules and guidelines referred to herein). Unless expressly stated otherwise by Wrike, any new features, new services, enhancements or modifications to the Service implemented after your initial access to the Service shall be subject to these TOS.</p>
<p><b>Waiver and Severability of Terms.</b> The failure of Wrike to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid under applicable law, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions to the greatest extent possible as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p><b>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability.</b> You agree that your Wrike account is non-transferable and any rights to your Wrike ID or contents within your account terminate upon cessation of your legal existence or death, as applicable. Upon receipt of a copy of a certificate of dissolution or death certificate, as applicable, your account may be terminated and all contents therein permanently deleted.</p>
<p><b>Statute of Limitations.</b> You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
<p>The section titles in the TOS are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.<br>
<b>Compliance</b>.<br>
