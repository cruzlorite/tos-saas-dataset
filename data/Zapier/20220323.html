Neither party may assign these Terms of Service without the prior written approval of the other, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that such approval shall not be required in connection with an assignment to an affiliate or to a successor to substantially all of such party’s assets or business related to these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service supersede all prior or contemporaneous discussions, proposals and agreements between you and Zapier relating to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect and such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and will be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. No waiver of rights by either party may be implied from any actions or failures to enforce rights under these Terms of Service or the Acceptable Use Policy. These Terms of Service and the Acceptable Use Policy are intended to be and are solely for the benefit of Zapier and you and do not create any right in favor of any third party. These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without reference to its conflict of laws principles.

All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco, California, and each party irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this
